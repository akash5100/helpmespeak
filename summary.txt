It looks like the deadline on the AI for accessibility grant has moved to January 12, 2022. I'm interested in working closely with at least one intern on pair programming to build a prototype that uses AI and/or match machine learning. For the internship position, we will be screen sharing for 1 to 2 hours a day.

Hi@ codemuncher code delete last word
I am currently unable to use my hands to type without extreme pain. For the past couple months I couldn't get typing through voice dictation to work in discord. On December 4 famousfigures show me a hack that got it to work on my computer. Basically to enable voice typing I have to show the on screen keyboard. Now I am finally able to communicate my ideas via chat instead of chewing them up in my head for when my hands get better. Thank you for asking and for thinking of me. Pardon any errors due to voice dictation period

Hi akash, I realize that it is almost 6 PM Pacific time which means that it is almost 7 AM 7:30 AM India standard time. What this means is that in a few minutes I will be switching over to working with actually on fell droid outcome. I know the time went by fast, and we didn't get a chance to review and work on your résumé and LinkedIn profile yet. Perhaps we can work on those together some other time. I'm getting pretty tired so after my session with actually I will call it a night and go have dinner with my husband and daughter. But I will be available either before your exams or after your exams, which ever Time you prefer. Thank you so much for all of your help with this AI force recognition project.
