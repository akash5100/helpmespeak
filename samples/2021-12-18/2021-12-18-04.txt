Hi @codemuncher, I am curently unable to use my hand to type without extreme pain. For the past couple of month I couldn't get typing through voice dictatin to work in discord. On December 4, @famousfigures showing me a hack that got it to work on my computers. Basically to enable a voice typing I have to show the on screen keyboard. Now I amm finally able to communicates a my ideas via chat instead of queue them up in my head for when my hands gets better. Thank you for asking and for thinking of myself. Paardon any errors due to voices dictation.

Hi everyone, last night sané showed me a little hack that turns on improved Voice control in discord. The result is:
One. I can now type messag with my voice in discord, like this one. (sidenote colon it's hard to edit those messages when voice recognition makes mistakes, which means at this point my biggest need has shifted from being able to type anything to wanting improved Voice recognition of message via an artificial intelligence)
Two. I have a greater control over the discord user interface see a number labels. I am now using quotation mark show Numbers continuously combined with the show keyboard hack that jump starts the number labels.
Overall this represents 1000% improvement in my discord user experience and overall Quality of life. Thank you@famous figures Space so much. Truly grateful.
