User text with speech-to-text errors: Hi everyone, last night sonny showed me a little hack that turns on improved Voice control in discord. The result is: One. I can now type messages with my voice in discord, like this one. (sidenote colon it's hard to edit those messages when voice recognition makes mistakes, which means at this point my biggest need has shifted from being able to type anything to wanting improved Voice recognition of message intent via artificial intelligence)
Two. I have a greater control over the discord user Interface see a number labels. I am now using quotation mark show Numbers continuously combined with the quotation mark show keyboard hack that jump starts the number labels.
